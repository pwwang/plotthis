# Common arguments for plots

Common arguments for plots

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- x:

  A character string specifying the column name of the data frame to
  plot for the x-axis.

- y:

  A character string specifying the column name of the data frame to
  plot for the y-axis.

- group_by:

  Columns to group the data for plotting For those plotting functions
  that do not support multiple groups, They will be concatenated into
  one column, using `group_by_sep` as the separator

- group_by_sep:

  The separator for multiple group_by columns. See `group_by`

- split_by:

  The column(s) to split data by and plot separately.

- split_by_sep:

  The separator for multiple split_by columns. See `split_by`

- keep_empty:

  A logical value indicating whether to keep empty groups. If FALSE,
  empty groups will be removed.

- theme:

  A character string or a theme class (i.e. ggplot2::theme_classic)
  specifying the theme to use. Default is "theme_this".

- theme_args:

  A list of arguments to pass to the theme function.

- palette:

  A character string specifying the palette to use. A named list or
  vector can be used to specify the palettes for different `split_by`
  values.

- palcolor:

  A character string specifying the color to use in the palette. A named
  list can be used to specify the colors for different `split_by`
  values. If some values are missing, the values from the palette will
  be used (palcolor will be NULL for those values).

- alpha:

  A numeric value specifying the transparency of the plot.

- x_text_angle:

  A numeric value specifying the angle of the x-axis text.

- aspect.ratio:

  A numeric value specifying the aspect ratio of the plot.

- title:

  A character string specifying the title of the plot. A function can be
  used to generate the title based on the default title. This is useful
  when split_by is used and the title needs to be dynamic.

- subtitle:

  A character string specifying the subtitle of the plot.

- xlab:

  A character string specifying the x-axis label.

- ylab:

  A character string specifying the y-axis label.

- legend.position:

  A character string specifying the position of the legend. if
  `waiver()`, for single groups, the legend will be "none", otherwise
  "right".

- legend.direction:

  A character string specifying the direction of the legend.

- expand:

  The values to expand the x and y axes. It is like CSS padding. When a
  single value is provided, it is used for both axes on both sides. When
  two values are provided, the first value is used for the top/bottom
  side and the second value is used for the left/right side. When three
  values are provided, the first value is used for the top side, the
  second value is used for the left/right side, and the third value is
  used for the bottom side. When four values are provided, the values
  are used for the top, right, bottom, and left sides, respectively. You
  can also use a named vector to specify the values for each side. When
  the axis is discrete, the values will be applied as 'add' to the
  'expansion' function. When the axis is continuous, the values will be
  applied as 'mult' to the 'expansion' function. See also
  <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/expansion.html>

- facet_by:

  A character string specifying the column name of the data frame to
  facet the plot. Otherwise, the data will be split by `split_by` and
  generate multiple plots and combine them into one using
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html)

- facet_scales:

  Whether to scale the axes of facets. Default is "fixed" Other options
  are "free", "free_x", "free_y". See
  [`ggplot2::facet_wrap`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html)

- facet_nrow:

  A numeric value specifying the number of rows in the facet. When
  facet_by is a single column and facet_wrap is used.

- facet_ncol:

  A numeric value specifying the number of columns in the facet. When
  facet_by is a single column and facet_wrap is used.

- facet_byrow:

  A logical value indicating whether to fill the plots by row. Default
  is TRUE.

- combine:

  Whether to combine the plots into one when facet is FALSE. Default is
  TRUE.

- nrow:

  A numeric value specifying the number of rows in the facet.

- ncol:

  A numeric value specifying the number of columns in the facet.

- byrow:

  A logical value indicating whether to fill the plots by row.

- axes:

  A string specifying how axes should be treated. Passed to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. Options
  are:

  - 'keep' will retain all axes in individual plots.

  - 'collect' will remove duplicated axes when placed in the same run of
    rows or columns of the layout.

  - 'collect_x' and 'collect_y' will remove duplicated x-axes in the
    columns or duplicated y-axes in the rows respectively.

- axis_titles:

  A string specifying how axis titltes should be treated. Passed to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. Options
  are:

  - 'keep' will retain all axis titles in individual plots.

  - 'collect' will remove duplicated titles in one direction and merge
    titles in the opposite direction.

  - 'collect_x' and 'collect_y' control this for x-axis titles and
    y-axis titles respectively.

- guides:

  A string specifying how guides should be treated in the layout. Passed
  to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. Options
  are:

  - 'collect' will collect guides below to the given nesting level,
    removing duplicates.

  - 'keep' will stop collection at this level and let guides be placed
    alongside their plot.

  - 'auto' will allow guides to be collected if a upper level tries, but
    place them alongside the plot if not.

- design:

  Specification of the location of areas in the layout, passed to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. When
  specified, `nrow`, `ncol`, and `byrow` are ignored. See
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html)
  for more details.

- seed:

  The random seed to use. Default is 8525.

- ...:
