## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- x:

  A character vector specifying the column as the rings of the plot.

- y:

  A character vector specifying the column as the y axis of the plot.
  Default is NULL, meaning the y axis is the count of the data.

- group_by:

  A character vector specifying the column as the group_by of the plot.
  How the ring is divided.

- group_by_sep:

  A character string to concatenate the columns in `group_by`, if
  multiple columns are provided.

- group_name:

  A character string to specify the name of the group_by in the legend.

- label:

  A logical value indicating whether to show the labels on the rings.
  The labels should be the values of group_by. Default is NULL, meaning
  no labels for one ring and showing the labels for multiple rings.

- clockwise:

  A logical value to draw the ring plot clockwise or not.

- keep_na:

  A logical value or a character to replace the NA values in the data.
  It can also take a named list to specify different behavior for
  different columns. If TRUE or NA, NA values will be replaced with NA.
  If FALSE, NA values will be removed from the data before plotting. If
  a character string is provided, NA values will be replaced with the
  provided string. If a named vector/list is provided, the names should
  be the column names to apply the behavior to, and the values should be
  one of TRUE, FALSE, or a character string. Without a named
  vector/list, the behavior applies to categorical/character columns
  used on the plot, for example, the `x`, `group_by`, `fill_by`, etc.

- keep_empty:

  One of FALSE, TRUE and "level". It can also take a named list to
  specify different behavior for different columns. Without a named
  list, the behavior applies to the categorical/character columns used
  on the plot, for example, the `x`, `group_by`, `fill_by`, etc.

  - `FALSE` (default): Drop empty factor levels from the data before
    plotting.

  - `TRUE`: Keep empty factor levels and show them as a separate
    category in the plot.

  - `"level"`: Keep empty factor levels, but do not show them in the
    plot. But they will be assigned colors from the palette to maintain
    consistency across multiple plots. Alias: `levels`

- facet_by:

  A character string specifying the column name of the data frame to
  facet the plot. Otherwise, the data will be split by `split_by` and
  generate multiple plots and combine them into one using
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html)

- facet_scales:

  Whether to scale the axes of facets. Default is "fixed" Other options
  are "free", "free_x", "free_y". See
  [`ggplot2::facet_wrap`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html)

- facet_ncol:

  A numeric value specifying the number of columns in the facet. When
  facet_by is a single column and facet_wrap is used.

- facet_nrow:

  A numeric value specifying the number of rows in the facet. When
  facet_by is a single column and facet_wrap is used.

- facet_byrow:

  A logical value indicating whether to fill the plots by row. Default
  is TRUE.

- theme:

  A character string or a theme class (i.e. ggplot2::theme_classic)
  specifying the theme to use. Default is "theme_this".

- theme_args:

  A list of arguments to pass to the theme function.

- palette:

  A character string specifying the palette to use. A named list or
  vector can be used to specify the palettes for different `split_by`
  values.

- palcolor:

  A character string specifying the color to use in the palette. A named
  list can be used to specify the colors for different `split_by`
  values. If some values are missing, the values from the palette will
  be used (palcolor will be NULL for those values).

- alpha:

  A numeric value specifying the transparency of the plot.

- aspect.ratio:

  A numeric value specifying the aspect ratio of the plot.

- legend.position:

  A character string specifying the position of the legend. if
  `waiver()`, for single groups, the legend will be "none", otherwise
  "right".

- legend.direction:

  A character string specifying the direction of the legend.

- title:

  A character string specifying the title of the plot. A function can be
  used to generate the title based on the default title. This is useful
  when split_by is used and the title needs to be dynamic.

- subtitle:

  A character string specifying the subtitle of the plot.

- xlab:

  A character string specifying the x-axis label.

- ylab:

  A character string specifying the y-axis label.

- seed:

  The random seed to use. Default is 8525.

- ...:

  Additional arguments.
