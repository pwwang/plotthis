## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame.

- x:

  A character string specifying the column name of the data frame to
  plot for the x-axis.

- y:

  A character string of the column name to plot on the y-axis. A numeric
  column is expected. If NULL, the count of each x column will be used.

- label:

  Which column to use as the label. NULL means no label. Default is the
  same as y. If y is NULL, you should use ".y" to specify the count as
  the label. If TRUE, the y values will be used as the label.

- split_by:

  The column(s) to split data by and plot separately.

- split_by_sep:

  The separator for multiple split_by columns. See `split_by`

- clockwise:

  A logical value to draw the pie chart clockwise or not.

- facet_by:

  A character string specifying the column name of the data frame to
  facet the plot. Otherwise, the data will be split by `split_by` and
  generate multiple plots and combine them into one using
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html)

- facet_scales:

  Whether to scale the axes of facets. Default is "fixed" Other options
  are "free", "free_x", "free_y". See
  [`ggplot2::facet_wrap`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html)

- facet_ncol:

  A numeric value specifying the number of columns in the facet. When
  facet_by is a single column and facet_wrap is used.

- facet_nrow:

  A numeric value specifying the number of rows in the facet. When
  facet_by is a single column and facet_wrap is used.

- facet_byrow:

  A logical value indicating whether to fill the plots by row. Default
  is TRUE.

- theme:

  A character string or a theme class (i.e. ggplot2::theme_classic)
  specifying the theme to use. Default is "theme_this".

- theme_args:

  A list of arguments to pass to the theme function.

- palette:

  A character string specifying the palette to use. A named list or
  vector can be used to specify the palettes for different `split_by`
  values.

- palcolor:

  A character string specifying the color to use in the palette. A named
  list can be used to specify the colors for different `split_by`
  values. If some values are missing, the values from the palette will
  be used (palcolor will be NULL for those values).

- alpha:

  A numeric value specifying the transparency of the plot.

- aspect.ratio:

  A numeric value specifying the aspect ratio of the plot.

- legend.position:

  A character string specifying the position of the legend. if
  `waiver()`, for single groups, the legend will be "none", otherwise
  "right".

- legend.direction:

  A character string specifying the direction of the legend.

- title:

  A character string specifying the title of the plot. A function can be
  used to generate the title based on the default title. This is useful
  when split_by is used and the title needs to be dynamic.

- subtitle:

  A character string specifying the subtitle of the plot.

- xlab:

  A character string specifying the x-axis label.

- ylab:

  A character string specifying the y-axis label.

- keep_empty:

  A logical value indicating whether to keep empty groups. If FALSE,
  empty groups will be removed.

- combine:

  Whether to combine the plots into one when facet is FALSE. Default is
  TRUE.

- nrow:

  A numeric value specifying the number of rows in the facet.

- ncol:

  A numeric value specifying the number of columns in the facet.

- byrow:

  A logical value indicating whether to fill the plots by row.

- seed:

  The random seed to use. Default is 8525.

- axes:

  A string specifying how axes should be treated. Passed to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. Options
  are:

  - 'keep' will retain all axes in individual plots.

  - 'collect' will remove duplicated axes when placed in the same run of
    rows or columns of the layout.

  - 'collect_x' and 'collect_y' will remove duplicated x-axes in the
    columns or duplicated y-axes in the rows respectively.

- axis_titles:

  A string specifying how axis titltes should be treated. Passed to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. Options
  are:

  - 'keep' will retain all axis titles in individual plots.

  - 'collect' will remove duplicated titles in one direction and merge
    titles in the opposite direction.

  - 'collect_x' and 'collect_y' control this for x-axis titles and
    y-axis titles respectively.

- guides:

  A string specifying how guides should be treated in the layout. Passed
  to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. Options
  are:

  - 'collect' will collect guides below to the given nesting level,
    removing duplicates.

  - 'keep' will stop collection at this level and let guides be placed
    alongside their plot.

  - 'auto' will allow guides to be collected if a upper level tries, but
    place them alongside the plot if not.

- design:

  Specification of the location of areas in the layout, passed to
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html).
  Only relevant when `split_by` is used and `combine` is TRUE. When
  specified, `nrow`, `ncol`, and `byrow` are ignored. See
  [`patchwork::wrap_plots()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/wrap_plots.html)
  for more details.
